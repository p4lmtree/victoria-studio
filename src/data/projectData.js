Use your imagination and the app will do the rest. The plane window symbolizes the moment where both physically and mentally you’re entering the holidays. It is the sas where suddenly the airport troubles and the luggage and all other preoccupations are left behind. It is the entry point to dreaming. As such, it is used as the entry point of the app, a space where you can relax and imagine your perfect getaway."
